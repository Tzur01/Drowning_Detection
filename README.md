# Drowning Detection 

This project implements a real-time **drowning detection system** using **RF-DETR (Small)** â€”
 a lightweight object detection model.  
 
The goal is to support early detection and intervention in water safety environments such as pools, beaches, and aquatic facilities.  


### The model is capable of detecting and classifying people in water as:
- **Safe** | 1,933 images
- **Struggling** | 1,917 images
- **Drowning** | 1,871 images


**Total Training Set:** 2,721
